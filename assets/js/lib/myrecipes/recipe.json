Pair it with a slaw or kale side salad and crusty whole-grain bread for a light, satisfying dinner. This recipe is ideal for a weekend, when you can check on the slow cooker after just a few hours; though you won't be able to leave the soup unattended all day, this still offers the benefit of hands-free, fuss-free cooking. Either baby red, Yukon Gold, or fingerling potatoes will work well here, as they'll maintain their shape nicely during cooking.\r\n","miscellaneous":{"internal_title":"ck-Slow Cooker Chicken, Bacon, and Potato Soup","field_headline":"<p>Slow Cooker Chicken, Bacon, and Potato Soup<\/p>\r\n","field_deck":"<p>This soup is perfect for ushering in fall: It's hearty enough for the beginning of soup season, yet brothy and veggie-packed so that it doesn't feel too heavy.
