{{! This partial is a test to show how a key can have two values. A string value or a structured array value.
This partial will render a body element if the value is a string for a list [array]}}
{{! The way to accomplish this is that the partial (such as this one) knows the key that it need to render.
For example - this partial should be included as partial when there is a 'body' key. This partial will look for that
key aand render it appropriately.}}

{{#body}}
    {{! render the literal value of the body if it's not a structured array }}
    {{! This requires a patch to the Mustache Compiler - Or it will print as 'Array'
    see -- pattern-lab/patches/fix-printing-array-value.diff}}
    {{{body}}}

    {{! if the body is an array the following partials will be invoked depending on the key }}
    {{! of a key of 'text' on the 'body' this will run }}
    {{&gt; organisms-texttest}}
    {{! of a key of 'image' on the 'body' this will run }}
